;; Note: If you leave out the call to (shutdown-agents), the program will on
;; most (all?) OS/JVM combinations "hang" for 1 minute before the process exits.
;; It is simply waiting for background threads, created by the future call, to
;; be shut down.  shutdown-agents will shut them down immediately, or
;; (System/exit <exit-status>) will exit immediately without waiting for them
;; to shut down.

;; This wait occurs even if you use futures indirectly through some other Clojure
;; functions that use them internally, such as pmap or clojure.java.shell/sh

;; http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-124 is a ticket opened against Clojure,
;; as this 1-minute wait is not considered desirable behavior.
